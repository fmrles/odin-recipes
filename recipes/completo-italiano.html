    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The “completo italiano” (Chilean Italian-Style Hot Dog) is undoubtedly the
      king of fast food in Chile, available practically anywhere, to the extent
      that some multinational fast food chains have incorporated it into their
      local menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name italiano is given by the similarity of its colors to those of the
      Italian flag, the red of the tomato, the green of the avocado, and the
      whitish color of homemade mayonnaise.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the sausages in half without separating them.</li>
      <li>
        In a medium pot, boil the hot dogs in hot water over medium heat for
        about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash and peel the tomatoes into small cubes, place in a bowl and season
        with salt and vegetable oil. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel and cut the avocados, mash with a <strong>fork</strong> until a
        coarse puree is formed, add a few drops of vegetable oil and season with
        salt to taste. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the buns in half without separating them and heat in a preheated
        oven at 100°C (212°F) or a flat toaster for about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In each bun, add a sausage, cover with a layer of tomato to taste,
        spread generously with avocado, and top with mayonnaise along the length
        of the bun.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the completo italiano immediately, optionally accompanied by
        mustard, ketchup, and red chili cream sauce to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can accompany it with a cold Coke or a hot cup of tea as indicated
        by your taste or the weather.
