    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A classic of national bakery and a favorite of many, Chilean marraqueta
      bread, also known as “pan batido” or “pan francés” depending on the region
      of the country, has a century-old history that only reaffirms its
      popularity, as today its production accounts for 70% of daily bread
      consumption throughout the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marraqueta is characterized by being a light bread made only from flour,
      water, and yeast, without fat, similar to the French baguette or the
      Spanish barra, with a crunchy texture and a rather neutral flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg of flour</li>
      <li>600 ml of lukewarm water</li>
      <li>20 g of salt (3 teaspoons)</li>
      <li>15 g of dry yeast (2 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>7 g of sugar (1 teaspoon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add some warm water to a large cup, add 15 grams of dry yeast or 45
        grams of fresh yeast, sugar, stir to dissolve, and let it rest for 10
        minutes in a warm place.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, sift the flour and salt, make a well in the center, and
        add the yeast mixture and the remaining water. Mix everything with your
        hands or a wooden spoon until you get a uniform, smooth, and semi-soft
        mixture, knead for about 10 minutes, and transfer the dough to a greased
        bowl. Cover with a clean cloth and let it ferment (rise) for about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into portions of approximately 100 grams each, roll
        each piece into a ball with the palm of your hand and gently knead into
        a circular shape. Place on a clean surface and let them rest covered for
        another 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gather two portions of dough and knead gently to give an elongated
        appearance, divide the dough in half perpendicularly with a long and
        thin object, giving the classic appearance of a marraqueta bread.
        Arrange the loaves on a buttered tray, brush with a little oil, and let
        them rest again for another 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to about 220°C (428°F) for about 15 minutes. Place the
        loaves in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes until they are lightly
        browned on the surface. Remove and cool on a rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the marraqueta bread hot or cold, alone, with butter, or with your
        preferred accompaniment.
      </li>
